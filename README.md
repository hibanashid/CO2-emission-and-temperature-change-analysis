# CO2-emission-and-temperature-change-analysis
Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis with Python
Overview
This project analyzes the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures using Python. It explores historical trends, detects anomalies, and simulates potential future scenarios to understand how changes in CO₂ concentrations influence temperature anomalies. The analysis leverages two primary datasets to uncover insights into the connection between carbon emissions and climate change.

Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:

Annual Temperature Changes Dataset: Contains data on global temperature changes across multiple countries and decades. This dataset helps identify trends in temperature fluctuations over time.

Monthly CO₂ Concentrations Dataset: Contains data on CO₂ concentrations measured globally on a monthly basis. It enables the analysis of the relationship between CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies.
